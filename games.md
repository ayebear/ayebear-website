# Multiversal

* A puzzle platformer game where the goal is to reach the end of each level.
* You can do this by solving various puzzles using a "window" into an alternate dimension.
* The window is controlled with your mouse. Whatever is seen through the window instantly becomes part of the real world.
* [Click here for an old demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msFEcX0TqVc)

# Avalanche

* A simple game that I made back in early 2011.
* The goal is to survive as long as possible without getting hit by icicles.
* You can get extra lives from health packs.
* You can collect force fields, and press space to use them. They last 5 seconds.

# aMAZEd (cancelled)

* This was going to be a puzzle game where you controlled a character with a top-down view.
* The goal was to use various items to manipulate the world, to reach the end of the levels.
* This was a team project. However, the rest of the team quit. I was unable to release this game due to legal IP issues.
