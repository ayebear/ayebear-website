2.5D sprite design and art style.

Sketched out some potential new sprites for mechanical clarity, with a new art style. Started on the code required for sorting the sprites to allow correct overlaps. Realized a refactor will be needed eventually for optimizing rendering - right now, full z-buckets are being re-created when any sprite in that bucket gets updated. Still need to figure out the inside and overlapping sprite bounds and aspect ratio. Not sure if it will be easier to draw the sprites in vector art to start with, as there is an aligned grid to work with.

The next few weeks will be difficult to keep up with updates, but I will try my best to prepare throughout the week to be able to post more content.
