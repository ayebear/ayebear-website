This is the first release of my untitled puzzle platformer game! It is a very early development version, and only has a few basic features. You can move and jump around on a map with a parallax scrolling background. The main character is animated, and there is working collision detection and handling.

I will be posting demo videos and/or screenshots in the future once the main game mechanics are implemented. I probably won’t come up with a name for it until it is finished, or once I have a better idea of the game’s mechanics and design.
