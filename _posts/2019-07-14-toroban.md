Working on the new input system.

There's an instance you can define with **all** the keys to handle in the configuration. You can define callbacks when there are state changes, or get the current key state. You can define the timings for the different states, such as initially pressed and held down. If this ends up being generic enough, I'll push it out as an open source npm package. The same goes for ActionTimeline. There may not be a lot of use cases for either, but it's good to get experience releasing fully tested and documented packages.
