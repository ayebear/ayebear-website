Integrated the new action timeline into Toroban!

## Updates

I integrated the new timeline data structures into the game. I had to rewrite all of the old actions to work with the new API. Fixed many bugs that came up after the initial upgrade.

Added the new Z/X/C/V keyboard controls for undo/redo/rewind/unwind.

Added new time mechanics: Consumable pause/play items, and pause/play areas. The consumables work perfectly, but the areas still need more work.

Currently trying to design a bunch of levels with these new mechanics. There's some more basic polish that needs to be done, like visual feedback on paused states. I think by the end of the month, I'll show some demo animations or videos.
