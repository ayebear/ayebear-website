Since the last post, there's been a few changes to the design, which hasn't been public until now so here is the full document: [Hex RTS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnfsjoi6IpPuqTeOdpOooX3lCy6pRKvgNoVzDZ6lAuY/edit?usp=sharing)

Here is a screenshot of the current prototype:

Currently, it's just a simple hexagonal tile map with panning, zooming, layers/z-indexing, and placing tiles. The textures are placeholders and will be replaced once the game is more finished.

Next I will be integrating an entity-component system and implementing the energy/economy logic with creating/destroying structures. I'm also going to try making a post every week on the current progress, with some kind of screenshot/video of the functionality.
