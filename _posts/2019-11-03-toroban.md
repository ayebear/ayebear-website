Lots of new sprites and graphical updates.

- 2.5D mirror sprites with clean light beams. All redirection types have correct beam sprites.
- 2.5D block sprites! Black blocks are now visible.
- New color palette, many more sprite updates.
- Extra color wall states, so shows solved/unsolved AND up/down independently.

There are many more minor changes as well. Will start working on the snake player very soon.
