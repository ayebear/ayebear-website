Food has color, player improvements, and fixed audio.

- Added color to food
  - This adds a constraint to color walls, such that food of that same color must not exist for the wall to be solved.
- Snake player updates
  - Paradoxes now block player segments
  - Fixed time travel issues with snake player
  - Fixed world wrapping animation issues by wrapping calculated positions
  - Updated colors to look more similar to other objects in the game
- Audio fixes
  - Fixed issue with audio sometimes not playing, caused by bad refresh code - the core of the problem has been fixed and now internal refreshes and initial level loads work correctly. This fixes de-dupe issues as well, so audio won't stack due to multiple refreshes - they get collapsed now.
  - Fixed audio stacking issue with player segments, now only each head movement produces audio
- Started on some laser-player interactions
  - Still working on making these very robust and simple for bug-free time travel with complex scenarios.
