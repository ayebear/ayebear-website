I finally migrated this website over to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). At the time of writing this, the domain is still being transferred.

I've been playing around with [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) and some other libraries, as I want to make games that are easier to access and play.

My latest project - which has been mostly kept secret up until now - is a multiplayer RTS game with a new take on economy and units. I'll try to make posts about it as it progresses. Currently it is in the prototyping stage, to find the best mechanics to use.
