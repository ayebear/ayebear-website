Visual time immune states.

### Updates

Fixed the incorrectly displaying paused states on entities:

### Future

Currently working on a new theme with all 2.5D sprites. May have to rework the sprite engine to support overlapping sprites in the correct order using x/y based z-indexes.

New theme:

* All black floors
* Walls are brick-like
  * To give contrast to floor/objects which are all less busy/noisy
* Color walls will look the same as normal walls (with some exceptions for smooth connections)
* Colors (lights) instead of lasers
  * Full tiles will be a certain color for the sources
  * Re-directions will also be the same color for a smooth connection
  * Mixtures that used to show 2 beams, now will show mixed colors
* Mirrors are all reworked to make more sense
  * Removed double mirrors
  * Side-to-side mirrors are simple triangular prisms
  * Floor-to-side mirrors are square bracket shaped prisms
* Goal blocks are cubes
  * Can see inside colors on all visible sides
* Time areas will fill the tile to represent an area
* Anything else missed here will be a surprise!
