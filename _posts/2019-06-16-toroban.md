Working on time levels.

## Updates

Added some new levels that require using the new time mechanics to solve them, such as this one:

![Example time level]({{ site.url }}/data/posts/2019_06_16_time_level.png)

## Next Steps

* Show paused states on all pause-able objects
* Make more time levels
* Single input system to manage all controls properly, to fix issues with pressing multiple keys at the same time
* Fix time areas - they kind of work, but the logic needs to be defined clearly first
  * This is lower priority, since there's a lot of levels I can still make with the consumable pause/play items
* UI controls for new time mechanics

Not sure about having a "time machine" you must pick up, to enable the rewind/unwind controls. It would probably introduce the same bugs as time areas, since unwinding a rewind would no longer reproduce the same state.
