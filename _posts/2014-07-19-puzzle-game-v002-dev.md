This is the second release of my puzzle platformer game. In this version, I made the magic window (still undecided what to call this exactly). The visual effect and collision handling works using the window. So you can jump on tiles in the alternate world, move the window away and you will fall. Or you can go into blocked off places by walking through tiles that donâ€™t exist in the alternate world.

Edit: A demo video will be posted as soon as I improve a few more things.
