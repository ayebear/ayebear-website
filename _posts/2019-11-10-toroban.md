Started on new snake player and other fixes and updates.

- Fixed rerun bug with new PicoES version, now lasers have instant rendering and don't lag multiple frames behind
- Made first 25 levels playable again with new mechanical tweaks
- Performance boost by skipping floor tiles rendering
- Implemented food, and creation of player segments with movement
