Here's an entity component system I've been working on recently. It supports using strings for component types, serialization/deserialization of entities and components, OOP style entities, and syntactic sugar for many operations.

I'll continue updating and supporting this for games that I work on in the future which will most likely use this. Any tips or suggestions are welcome and may be taken into consideration.
