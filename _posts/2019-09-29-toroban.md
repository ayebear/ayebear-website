Bug fixes and graphics rework.

Fixed life points bugs with entering life points with lasers in the same location. Now, even at maximum health, you'll still absorb the life point if it's in a laser, and you won't gain or lose any health.

Fixed issues with sound effects playing initially on certain levels with recursive color walls. Also fixed paradoxes randomly showing up on initial level loads - this was caused by the player entity being created too late, it's now created in the correct order.

Experimented with 2.5D pixel art, but considering using isometric vector art. It's much easier to make clean, minimalistic art, with the only major tradeoff being PC controls are offset by 45 degrees. The sprite ordering still has to be done, but the overlaps are more well-defined, and this results in everything staying visible enough for recognition as long as nothing is more than one full tile high.
