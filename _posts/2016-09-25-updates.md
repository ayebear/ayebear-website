I made another Entity System, this one is for JavaScript (ES6) though: [https://github.com/ayebear/picoes](https://github.com/ayebear/picoes)

Once that is setup properly, I'll integrate it into Project Square and start working on that again. There will be lots of interesting game mechanics included in the game!
