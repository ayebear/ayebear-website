Fixed the new UI buttons.

### Updates

Integrated hammer.js (again) and just used the basic swipe gesture for movement. This allows the UI buttons to be pressed without conflicting with player movement.

This upcoming week I have more time allocated to work on Toroban. Planning on adding the new menu UI, experimenting with push-able items, adding more levels, and/or working on a new graphics style.
