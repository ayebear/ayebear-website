Some cool things I am currently working on:

* Otplib - One Time Pad Library
  * Used for theoretically uncrackable encryption over a network/the Internet.
    * This is possible because the key data is random, and the same size as the plain text input.
    * Also, there are key files used to encrypt, which get "used up", and securely erased immediately.
  * Will be making an OTP chat program with a GUI using this library.
  * More information on how this works will be available soon.
* CAH - Cellular Automata Hash
  * A hash algorithm that works by simulating cellular automata.
  * Not claiming any security or performance with this, but it seems interesting.
  * [More information available here.](https://github.com/ayebear/CAH)
* Puzzle Game (still undecided on the name)
  * The next update will have working switches and puzzle elements controlled by them!
