Fixed more timeline bugs.

Fixed a bug with pruning the timeline too early - now it includes the full action list that was added. Also, it deduplicates the requests to prune, so it will only happen once.

Added pause states to the player. Found out I need a better rendering system based on state, so that will need to be improved first.

The properly queued input system is something I'm still working on. Hopefully I can get more done this week to show off more next post.
