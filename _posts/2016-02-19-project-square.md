I've been working on a new game lately (yes, I am making time for it somehow), called Project Square. It's a 2D rendering of a 3D world.

I'm currently making a prototype to test if layer shifting or perspective rotating provides better mechanics without being too confusing. I'm putting the RTS on hold to get more acquainted with JavaScript game development. Already with this project I've found better libraries and setup an entity-component-system, using ES6 with babel/rollup, and am starting with the most correct code design possible. Plus this should only take a few months to make something relatively well polished.

Screenshots/demos will be posted as progress is made, the code is open source, and on GitHub here: [https://github.com/ayebear/project-square](https://github.com/ayebear/project-square).
