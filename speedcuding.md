# Speedcubing Timer

-   This is an old AutoIt program I wrote years ago. I may rewrite a better version of this in the future that is cross-platform.

# My Speedcubing Status

-   [Here is my WCA profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2012HEBE01) so you can see how slow I am at speedcubing.
-   I may also post videos of speedcubing on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO5dyB7h-s9UU8KYEbv487A).
