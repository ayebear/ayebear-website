[Speedcubing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) is when you try to solve a twisty puzzle - such as a Rubik's cube - as fast as you can.

# Speedcubing Timer
* This is an old AutoIt program I wrote years ago. I may rewrite a better version of this in the future that is cross-platform.

# My Speedcubing Status
* [Here is my WCA profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2012HEBE01) so you can see how slow I am at speedcubing.
* I may also post videos of speedcubing on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO5dyB7h-s9UU8KYEbv487A).
